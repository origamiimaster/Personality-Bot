 (impressed) Bold move, brother. Even for me.Loki runs off, leaving Thor and Val to deal with Hela.
 (points) The Commodore. The COMMODORE starship. Brand new, solidly built, sleek. As they walk towards it a DUPLICATE LOKI FORMS and LAGS BEHIND. The Loki walking with Thor is an illusion.
 ...Did you just agree with me?
 ...I have been falling...for thirty minutes!
 ..you think you're some kind of sorcerer? Don't think for one minute, you second-rate...
 Adopted.
 Alright, I yield!Thor DROPS Loki to the ground and catches Mjolnir. Lokilooks to Thor, hands up defensively. Skurge arrives on thescene, a little late to warn Loki.
 Beg your pardon?Hela MANIFESTS a pitch black blade.
 Bring us back!
 Brother.Thor faces Loki. Electricity CRACKLES at Thor's hands.
 Did you miss me? Everybody on that ship, now.The Asgardian refugees begin POURING onto the ark. The onlyway onto the Ark is a narrow plankway, so there is animmediate bottleneck effect - thousands of frightened peopleall pushing for a chance at salvation. It's mayhem.Loki walks through the crowd to Heimdall.
 Do we have to hug now? Thor smiles.
 Do you really think it's a good idea to go back to Earth?
 Do you truly think so little of me? Thor pauses, considers his brother. Then:
 Easier to let it burn. But then Loki sees Thor holding up a fob device. Loki realizes that Thor affixed an Obedience Disk on him in that heart-to-heart moment.
 Excuse me one second.
 Grandmaster, I-
 Handle me? Who are you?
 Heavens, no. I've run out of favor with the Grandmaster.
 Hello, Bruce.
 Here's the thing. I'm probably better off staying here on Sakaar.
 Hey.
 Hi! Thor and Loki BLAST all the guards, moving to another door.
 Hit her with a lightning blast.
 How was I supposed to know? Can't see into the future. I'm not a witch.
 I can't.
 I could do it in one.
 I didn't get a chair.
 I disagree. Open communication was never our family's forte.
 I don't mean to impose, but the Grandmaster has a great many ships. I may eve have stolen the access codes to his security system.All eyes turn to Loki. Valkyrie throws her bottle at him. Itsmashes above his head.
 I hate it.
 I have to get off this planet.Loki tries to exit, but the Grandmaster stops him.
 I know I've betrayed you many times before, but this time it's truly nothing personal. The reward for your capture will set me up nicely. He triggers the alarm.
 I still hate it. It's humiliating.
 I swear, I left him right here.
 I'm honored.
 I'm not doing "Get help."Thor sees Hela approaching. He sees the palace behind her. Hecomes to a realization.
 I've gained his favor.. The Bi- Frost brought me out here weeks ago.
 I've made friends with this man. He's called the Grandmaster.
 I've never met this man in my life.
 It varies from moment to moment. Val's apartment is a shithole. Bottles everywhere, blood- spattered clothes in the corner, a knife in the wall, etc. Banner gives Thor a look like "she might be crazy." Thor responds with a "No, she's cool" gesture.
 It's Loki. And you will answer to the Grandmaster.
 It's humiliating.
 It's probably for the best that we never see one another again.Beat. Thor pats Loki affectionately on the shoulder.Hold on Loki. Did Thor just get through to him?
 Let me rephrase: Do you really think it's a good idea to bring me back to Earth? Thor smiles, getting it. Pats Loki on the shoulder.
 Maybe not.
 My dear friend, if you were to give me twelve hours I could bring them both back to you.
 No.
 No.
 Of course you did. Loki joins Heimdall and the gladiators in fending off Hela's encroaching minions.
 Perhaps we can reach an arrangement.
 Terribly sorry. Must be a very painful memory... Quick as a rattlesnake, Loki GRABS Val's head and CASTS an illusion. Val's eyes CLOUD OVER with darkness as we go to:
 Thank you.
 There was a wormhole in space and time beneath me. At that moment, I let go.
 This is madness. The ship ACCELERATES towards the palace of Asgard.
 This... isn't me. WHOOMPF! Loki DROPS out of sight, vanishing through solid concrete! Thor sees a CARD on the sidewalk where Loki was. Thor pokes the business card.
 We are not doing "Get Help."
 What are you doing here?
 What have you done!? Val reverses position, putting Loki up against the wall.
 What?
 What? You're alive?
 Why not set the beast loose?
 With the Eternal Flame, you are reborn. As the fire CRACKLES, Surtur's skull begins to GROW.
 Yes! That's how it feels! (to Grandmaster:) I'm just a huge fan of the sport.Thor is SMASHED into the floor face first.Hulk ROARS and RUSHES Thor with his axe.
 Yes, brother. I can.
 You do seem like you're in desperate need of leadership.
 You had one job! Just the one.
 You had what you wanted, you had the independence you asked for!Thor PRESSES Mjolnir onto Loki's chest.
 You just couldn't stay away, could you? Everything was fine without you. Asgard was prospering (gestures to the crowd) You've ruined everything. Ask them.Those who aren't freaked out are becoming gradually angrier.Thor advances on Loki, who backs up onto the chaise lounge.
 You know, I haven't seen this Beloved Champion he talks of, but I've heard he's astonishingly savage. I've placed a large wager against you tomorrow. Don't let me down. Loki SHIMMERS, and his illusion vanishes. Korg runs in to try to kick him.
 You're a Valkyrie. I thought the Valkyrie all died gruesome deaths? Now Val ATTACKS Loki! She gets him up against the wall, her blade against his throat. She looks ready to kill him.
 You're missing an eye. Valkyrie finishes off a handful of enemies, but then notices something. She WHISTLES to get the others' attention.
 Your savior is here!The fog dissipates around him, revealing that Loki's standingon THE GRANDMASTER'S SUPERCRUISER! For reasons that willbecome clear, we will henceforth call this ship THE ARK.And Loki is not alone. He's brought along all the prisonersfrom the Contest of Champions. Armed with gladiator weapons.The Ark slows to a stop at the middle of bridge.ABOVE: Even with Hela's hand on his throat, Thor can't helpbut smile at the sight of Loki. Hela however sneers.



 (to the falling Giant) Pathetic. He turns back to the battle. Two Jotuns come at him from either side. He lets two daggers fly, felling both Giants at once. Laufey nods to one of his guards -- a massive Jotun BRUTE. The Brute leaps down from the balcony, icing himself up, then punches his giant fist into the ice beneath his feet. It's a long-range attack, causing PILLARS OF ICE to explode out in front of Hogun, sending the grim warrior flying back. Across the plaza, Thor easily dispatches some Jotuns.
 All these years, and no one's ever dared to use it as a weapon. Thor hurries to the ice, raises his hammer to SMASH through it to get to the controls frozen within. Before he can, Loki fires Gungnir. The blast hits the ice in front of Thor, blasting him back across the floor. Loki steps down from the ice as Thor staggers to his feet.     4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 107.
 Am I cursed?
 Am I? He looks his brother in the eye, all pretense lost.
 And if I do, then what? I love Thor more dearly than any of you, but you know what he is. He's arrogant. He's reckless. He's dangerous. You saw how he was today. Is that what Asgard needs from its King? The others exchange glances, torn. Loki has a point. He leaves the room. Hogun stares after him.
 And why is that?
 And your death came by the son of Odin.     4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 104A. Laufey dies as the other two shocked Frost Giants move for Loki. He fires Gungnir at one, blasting him against a wall, taking him out.     4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 105. The Brute is nearly upon him, when the Jotun stops suddenly, his eyes going wide. The Brute falls to the ground,
 As I recall, I was the one who veiled us in smoke to ease our escape.
 Because I am the monster parents tell their children about at night?
 Because no matter how much you claim to "love" me, you could never have a Frost Giant sitting on the Throne of Asgard! Odin's body begins to shake, he lifts his hand. It starts to move out of synch temporarily, leaving a trail, the effect of the Odinsleep approaching. Loki doesn't notice as Odin tries to fight it off.
 But there's nothing we can do without defying Father. Thor considers this, looks at his hammer, a gleam in his eye. Loki can guess what he's thinking, grows concerned.
 Damn. In one quick move, Thor pulls Mjolnir, swings it, and KNOCKS the Jotun clear across the plaza. The Asgardians reluctantly draw their weapons, gather into a circle around Thor. Volstagg looks around at the angry Jotuns approaching them.
 Ensure my brother does not return.
 Exactly. Just as you're sworn to obey me now. Yes? A beat.
 Father is dead. Thor stares at him, stunned.
 Father's fallen into the Odinsleep. My mother fears he may never awaken again.
 Father. Welcome to Asgard.
 Found its way back to you, did it?
 Get me off this bridge before it cracks under your girth. Volstagg and Fandral share a laugh.
 Give us a kiss.
 Good. Then you will open the Bifrost to no one until I have undone what my brother has started. Loki heads out of the Observatory. Heimdall stares after him.     4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 78A.
 Guards!
 He said he'd be along. Sif realizes the truth, shakes her head in disapproval.
 How long will it last?     4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 53.
 I am not your brother. I never was.
 I had to see you.
 I never get used to seeing him like this. The most powerful being in the Nine Realms lying helpless until his body is restored.
 I never wanted the throne. I only wanted to be your equal. Now fight me!     4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 108. With a gesture of Gungnir, he flings Thor to the ground. Thor rises to his feet, turns to Loki.
 I saved our lives! And Thor's. I had no idea Father would banish him for what he did.
 I told him to go to Odin after we'd left. Though he should be flogged for taking so long.     4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 46.
 I told him.     4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 45A.
 I was being sincere!
 I will conceal you and a handful of your soldiers, lead you into his chambers, and let you slay him where he lies. I'll keep the throne, and you will have the Casket. Laufey studies Loki's face.
 I wouldn't worry. Father will forgive him. He always does.     4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 13. Just then, at the back of the hall, up the steps from the lower level --
 I'm sorry?
 I've come alone and unarmed.
 If you care so much for the Jotuns, then die with them. The Bifrost stretches every cell of Thor's body, trying to drag him away. He's nearly swallowed by the vortex, when he concentrates, mustering his will. He reaches out his hand towards the Bifrost. MJOLNIR flies back through the maelstrom, into Thor's hand. The hammer pulls him free. Loki tries to fire off another blast at him, but Thor takes to the air, speeds towards his brother.
 Is it? He FIRES Gungnir at Thor. Thor dodges the blast, rolls to his feet.
 It all makes sense now. Why you favored Thor all these years.
 It must have been enforcing Father's last command.     4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 106.
 It will come. In time.
 It's madness!
 Just a bit of fun. (to the Attendant) Right, my friend? The Attendant isn't so sure. Thor dons his EAGLE-WINGED
 Keep your weapons sheathed and your mouths closed. This is going to take subtlety and sincerity, not brute strength. Leave it to me. Loki dismounts and steps forward.
 Laufey's son... He desperately struggles to make sense of it all.     4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 48A.
 Like a king. They hear the blast of a CEREMONIAL HORN.
 Likely killed us all! As the Jotuns race towards the Asgardians, they open their mouths wide and breathe out an ICY FOG. The swirling mists quickly engulf the fleeing Asgardians before them. The Asgardians stand in the mist, unable to see. Hogun takes a step back, the ice cracking beneath him. They dare not move, for fear of falling through, into the void below. Thor sees he's put his friends in even greater danger. He raises Mjolnir high, SUMMONING THE WINDS. They lift him off the ground and carry him across the frozen wasteland to his comrades.
 Look at you, the Mighty Thor. With all your strength, what good does it do you now? Thor knows Loki's right. He's powerless to stop what's happening. He looks down at the Bridge beneath his feet, VIBRATING from the force and speed of the Bifrost energy feeding into the Observatory. Then he gets an idea. He realizes what he must do -- and what he must sacrifice. Thor extends his hand towards Loki, summoning Mjolnir. The hammer goes flying to his grasp. Loki looks confused.     4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 111. Thor raises Mjolnir in the air. Clouds form above him, thunder RUMBLING. Lightning arcs off of his hammer, as he channels the power of the storm into it, then -- He strikes Mjolnir down upon the Rainbow Bridge. The blow is massive, causing a rumbling along the whole bridge, shaking the Observatory itself like an earthquake. A crack appears where the blow struck. Loki rises to his feet.
 Mother has forbidden your return. Thor nods, lowers his head, beaten.
 My first command can not be to undo the Allfather's last. We're on the brink of war with Jotunheim. Our people must have a sense of continuity in order to feel safe in these difficult times. Sif and the Warriors Three trade looks, not liking any of this.
 My friends... you haven't heard? I am now Ruler of Asgard.
 No longer weak. I now rule Asgard, until Odin awakens. Perhaps you should not have so carelessly abandoned me. This gives Laufey pause.
 No. Asgard is mine. The rest of the Nine Realms will be yours, if you do as you're told. Laufey considers the proposition.
 Nothing could have stopped me. Coulson enters the room, but seems to take no notice of Loki.
 Nothing! Thor was making a jest!
 Perhaps we should wait. Thor turns back to his brother.
 Perhaps your senses have weakened after your many years of service.
 She has refused to leave my father's bedside. You can bring your "urgent" matter to me, your King. Sif covers quickly.
 Sitting sprawled upon his father's throne. He wears his horned ceremonial headdress and holds GUNGNIR in his hand. Sif and the others look up, shocked at the sight before them.
 So I am no more than another stolen relic, locked up here until you might have use of me.
 So have I. Loki hits Thor across the face with Gungnir.
 So why did he lie?
 That can't be good.
 The truce with Jotunheim is conditional upon your exile.
 There was the time in Nornheim...
 Thor! Help me! Thor steps over to the side of the Bridge, sees Loki looking up at him desperately.
 Thor, stop and think. Look around you. We are outnumbered.
 Thor, we must go! Thor, still without his hammer, fights his Jotun foes mercilessly, a man consumed by blood lust. Loki sees the look on his brother's face -- the savage thrill of the heat of battle.
 To do what Father never could. To destroy their kind forever. When he awakens, he'll see the wisdom of what I've done.
 To make you another proposition.
 To survey the enemy. To gauge their strengths and weaknesses from a distance.     4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 25.
 We will accept your most gracious offer. The others look to Thor imploringly. Thor stares Laufey down a beat -- then relents. He turns to leave. His comrades breathe a sigh of relief and follow, when a Frost Giant nearby mutters under his breath.     4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 28.
 What am I?
 What hope is there for Thor?
 What is this newfound love for the Frost Giants? You, who would have killed them all with your bare hands.
 What more than that? Odin doesn't answer. He looks suddenly weary, burdened. Loki sizes him up, realizes the truth.
 What troubles you, Gatekeeper?     4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 78.
 What?
 When all is done, we will have a permanent peace between our two worlds. Then I, the bastard son, will have accomplished what Odin and Thor never could.
 Who said I was wise?
 Yes, of course! I won't let my brother march into Jotunheim alone. I will be at his side.
 You could have told me what I was from the beginning. Why didn't you?
 You have great power, Heimdall. Tell me, did Odin ever fear you?
 You have no idea what I am. The blueness spreads across his face, as Laufey and the guards stare in shock. Loki grins.
 You must be mistaken. We're not--
 You think the Bifrost is the only way in and out of the Realm? There are secret paths between worlds to which even you with all your gifts are blind. But I have need of them no longer, now that I am King.
 You took me for a purpose, what was it? Odin doesn't answer.
 You're welcome.
 Your banishment, the threat of a new war, it was too much for him to bear. The implications of Loki's words dawn on Thor -- he's responsible for his father's fate. Loki draws close to him, looks in his eyes, consolingly.
