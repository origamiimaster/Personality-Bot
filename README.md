# Personality-Bot
Discord Bot for the Discord Hack Week

# The Idea

This bot uses markovify to act out as users, without directly copying users.

In addition, the bot can mimic any set of text provided in the personality folder. 

Some test examples have been provided. 

# Setup

First, make sure that you have the correctly installed Python3, this was tested with 3.7.3

Next, install the dependencies with pip, which are discord.py and markovify.  

The bot token should be pasted within a file labeled "token.txt", located in the main directory.  

Finally, run the main.py file to begin the bot.  

# Adding additional personalities 

Take the example text of whoever you wish to mimic, with punctuation separating sentences. 

The more text there is, the more success the bot will have with generating satisfactory responses.  

However, large files may take longer for the bot to initialize.  

# The Future

Eventually, this or a similar bot will be created using more ai learning techniques to mimic historic debates between historic figures and characters of fantasy.  

Imagine Epic Rap Battles Of History, but with any two characters there is text written about.  

Even though this is still a far off prospect, Personality-Bot is an important step in the right direction.
