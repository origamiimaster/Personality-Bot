 Hey Joey! Earth to Joey! Hey, are you in there? It's your turn. Yup! Pretty good move, but not good enough.  You did fine, Joey. I just have better cards. See, my Grandpa owns a game shop and I get all my best cards from him.  Okay, maybe I could even get my Grandpa to show us this super rare card he's got. Grandpa? I'm home. Gramps, could you show my friends your awesome, super rare card?  Please! Please! Seto Kaiba! Whoa! Take it easy, Joey.  You'd feel the same even if it were a common card, right Grandpa? Me too! Grandpa, I'm home.  Hello. Game Shop. Kaiba?! Kaiba! What've you done, Kaiba?! Grandpa! Grandpa. A-are you okay? Grandpa! Grandpa's most treasured card! Grandpa! Hold on.  How could you do such a thing?  Huh? Grandpa.  But Grandpa, you need help. I've got to get you to a doctor.  Huh?  I don't know...  Okay, Grandpa. I'll do it. Play-time is over, Kaiba.  Oh yeah, the Breath of Life wears down rock monsters.  Well, let's start by checking your deck, Joey. Thanks.   No one could win with these. Joey, your deck's filled with nothing but monster cards. But that's not how the game works. Duel Monsters is all about combining your monster cards with your magic cards to increase their strength.  With no magic in your deck, your monsters will be creamed every time. Umm... My Grandpa's the real game expert in the family, maybe he can help you.  Hey Grandpa! I brought you a new student! Actually, Téa beat you five times in a row, Joey. Nice going there, smartmouth. Listen, Joey. Teaching you Duel Monsters is too big a challenge, even for my grandpa. Joey, he already said he can't do it. And if he can't do it, he can't do it. And on top of that, you're so tired you can't keep your eyes open. I think Grandpa's lessons have been a bit too tough for him. A package? What is it, Gramps? Huh.  it's from Industrial Illusions. I have no idea. Is it possible they heard I beat the world champion? Yeah. It wasn't an official duel or anything, but Kaiba did drop out of the tournament because of me. Oh yeah. They're both pretty tough customers. Weevil specializes in insect cards and he's a great strategist. Then you've got Rex Raptor and his dinosaur cards. He uses their power to overwhelm his opponents. I wouldn't be so sure.  Maybe, but I wouldn't underestimate Weevil. What could it be?   Okay.  Huh? Wha-? Everything's growing dark and cold and the others aren't moving. What have you done to them? Where have you taken us? Then it's time to duel!  Grandpa! Grandpa! Grandpa!! Grandpaaaaaa!  What could it be?   Grandpa! Grandpa!! Grandpaaaaaa! How did I get into this mess? I can't believe that grandpa's actually gone. One minute he's right beside us, and the next, Pegasus shows up and uses some sort of weird magic to steal his soul away. But why? What could Pegasus possibly want with me? And could it have something to do with my Millennium Puzzle?  Huh? It's an invitation to the tournament at Duelist Kingdom. Maybe. The only way to know for sure is to become a contestant. The boat's going to be leaving in two days. I have to go. It's the only clue I have for rescuing Grandpa. So what, Tristan. Who cares about money at a time like this. Guess Joey does... Joey? What're you doing up here? What's with you? Of course I know.  Mmmm. Hah, that really means a lot to me, Joey. I'm glad we're friends. I'll never forget it. It was all because of the Millennium Puzzle. The way Grandpa explained it to me, the Puzzle was originally found in some Egyptian ruins. My Grandpa gave it to me and kind of dared me to solve it. It was the most incredible thing I'd ever seen. As soon as I touched it, I knew it was special. I made a wish on the Puzzle. I asked it to give me a real friend. And I think the puzzle came through for me. That was when I met up with you and Tristan. Although you sure didn't act like my friends at first. Teasing? You took a piece of the Millennium Puzzle and threw it out the window. And I was the one who helped you guys out when that bully picked on you. Get back! Leave them alone!  I won't let you. These guys are my friends.   Well, at least you retrieved the lost puzzle piece. If you hadn't done that, I could never have solved the Millennium Puzzle. Oh, were you acting? Huh?  Mmm. Yeah! Too bad you can't go with me to rescue Grandpa. Huh?! Together?! But how can you go without an invitation? Joey? What the-? Leave him alone. Joey! What're you doing here, Joey? He's with me. You've got to let him on. But Joey has a star chip. Didn't he tell you?  According to this card, a star chip's proof that one is a duelist. Maybe. But I'd rather take that risk than be without my friend when we get to the Duelist Kingdom. I'm glad they let you on board, Joey. Then be quiet about it. Yeah. Uh, thanks very much. I think... Huh? Yeah. And you're- Congratulations on winning the regionals, Weevil. I look forward to it too. Oh, isn't that cheating? Oh, I bet this is how Weevil gets so much insight into his opponent's strategy. Guess Joey's trading. Hey, let me see them. Salamandra and a Kunai with Chain. Baby Dragon and Shield and Sword! Great! With these new magic cards combined with your monsters, you'll have a real strong deck.  I think you're going to find it's a bit harder than that, Joey. Here.  Add this to your deck. It can be helpful in a tight spot. Ah, Weevil. Nah. I'm gonna duel with the cards I brought along with me. And really rare. I don't see why not. Just be careful with them. Okay?  Here! Huh? No! My cards! Those were the Exodia cards that my grandpa gave me. Joey, don't! Joey, where are you?! Joey, they're not worth drowning over. Joey, swim back to the ship. Joey!  Joey! Hold on! Joey!  Téa, Tristan! That was close. I'm sure glad you two guys showed up. Really glad. Thanks a lot, you guys. Huh?! It's okay, Joey. Serenity? I'm sorry. We'll both do our best, Joey! You, for your sister. And me, for my grandpa. That's the Duelist Kingdom. That's it. We're almost there.
