Voice: Long ago, when the pyramids were still young, the Egyptian Kings played a game of great and terrible power. But these Shadow Games erupted into a war that threatened to destroy the entire world. Until a brave and powerful pharaoh locked the magic away, imprisoning it within the mystical Millennium Items. Now, five thousand years later, a boy named Yuugi unlocks the secret of the Millennium Puzzle. He is infused with ancient magical energies, for destiny has chosen him to defend the world from the return of the Shadow Games, just as the brave Pharaoh did five thousand years ago.

[Cue themesong]

[Cut to the school, Yuugi and Joey are playing a card game with a group of students around them]

Yuugi: Hey Joey! Earth to Joey! Hey, are you in there? It's your turn.

Joey: Ummm... 

Tristan: Oh, isn't he cute when he's thinking?

Joey: Hey Tristan, Yuugi here's teaching me how to play Duel Monsters. 

Tristan: Drooling monsters?

Joey: Duel Monsters, you nimrod. 

Tristan: Sheesh.

Téa: They've been at it for hours. Joey's starting to get the hang of the game, but Yuugi's like an expert.

Joey: Okay Yuugi. It's time to duel.

Téa: See, each card has an attack number and a defense number. The first player to eliminate the other player's life points wins the duel.

Joey: Pretty good move, huh Yuugi?

Yuugi: Yup! Pretty good move, but not good enough.

Joey: What?! Thanks a lot. A card that powerful totally wipes me out.

Tristan: Whoa, you stink at this game, Joey. 

Yuugi: [laughs] You did fine, Joey. I just have better cards. See, my Grandpa owns a game shop and I get all my best cards from him. 

Joey: Your own game shop. What're we waiting for? Let's go!

Yuugi: Okay, maybe I could even get my Grandpa to show us this super rare card he's got.

Seto: Rare card? Could they have found the card that I've been searching for?

[Cut to the Turtle Game Shop]

Yuugi: Grandpa? I'm home.

Solomon: And I see you've brought company. 

Yuugi: Gramps, could you show my friends your awesome, super rare card? 

Solomon: Rare card? My special card? Hmmm... 

Yuugi: Please! Please!

Joey: Pretty please?

Solomon: Hmmm... Hah hah! How could I refuse? You kids are in for a treat. I don't take this card out too often. Ready? Here it is.
The Blue-Eyes White Dragon, so rare, so powerful, I never let it leave my hands.

Joey: Awesome!

Tristan: [snatches the BEWD out of Solomon's hands] It doesn't look all that special to me...

Solomon: Ahh! This card is priceless. There are only four of them in all the world.

Joey: Speaking of priceless, I'm ready to trade! 

Solomon: Not for this card.

Joey: Huh? Nah, I didn't mean that card. I meant, show me some other cool cards to get me started.

[The door opens, enter Seto Kaiba]

Solomon: Hello, can I help you? 

Téa: Huh?

Seto: If you can't, it certainly wouldn't surprise me.

Yuugi: Seto Kaiba!

Joey: Kaiba?!

Tristan: Doesn't he have a big fancy company to run? What's he doing down here?

Seto: Not that it's any of your business, but I came to see the card.

Joey: [smiles and steps forward] Hey, are you into Duel Monsters too? This is perfect. Maybe we could all duel together sometime. 

Seto: [walks into the shop] Me? Duel you? I'd have more of a challenge playing solitaire.

Joey: What?

Seto: I am the number one ranked duelist in the country, and the favorite to win the Duel Monsters championship. Hah, you wouldn't last two minutes in a duel against me.

Joey: [clenches fist] Ooh, I'm shaking. Maybe you'd like to settle this with fists instead of cards.

Yuugi: Whoa! Take it easy, Joey. 

Joey: But Yuugi, Kaiba's asking for it.

Seto: Now does this shop have any worthwhile cards or not? [catches sight of the BEWD, lurches forward] Can it be? The Blue-Eyes White Dragon in a dump like this? It is. The card I've been searching for.

Solomon: [covers the BEWD] Well, enough window shopping. Is there anything else I can help you with?

Seto: [growls, lifts his briefcase onto the counter and opens it]

Solomon: Huh? Oooh.

Seto: Listen to me, old man. Gimme your Blue-Eyes White Dragon card and I'll trade you all of these. 

All: Whoa!

Solomon: Ahh, nice. But no thanks.

All: Huh?!

Seto: Nngh. Fine. If you won't trade, maybe you'll sell it. Name your price. I can pay anything you ask.

Solomon: I'm sure you could. But this card is worth more than you could ever offer. Not because of its power or because it's so rare, but because of what it means to me. This card was given to me by a dear friend and so I treasure this card as I do that friend. So parting with it is completely out of the question.

Seto: No!

Yuugi: You'd feel the same even if it were a common card, right Grandpa?

Solomon: Exactly. You see, this precious card has bonded with my heart.

Seto: Fine! I've heard enough of your nonsense. [closes briefcase and walks away] Senile old fool.

[Cut to exterior of Game Shop, a car drives away]

[Cut to interior of the car]

Seto: Heart of the cards. Ridiculous. Cards are all about power. And one way or another, his Blue-Eyes White Dragon card... will be mine.

[Cut to exterior of the KaibaCorp building]

Seto: Gentlemen, there's a little something I'd like you to pick up for me at the Game Shop.

Lackey: Gladly, Master Kaiba.

[Cut to the exterior of the Game Shop, two men step in front of the camera]

[Cut to interior of the Game Shop. Solomon is standing in front of the counter]

Solomon: Good morning. [turns around] Hmm?

Lackey: [steps forward] My master, Seto Kaiba, challenges you to a duel. You may come with us now.

Solomon: And if I were to decline?

Lackey: [glasses glint ominously] I'm afraid I must... insist.

Solomon: Young Kaiba doesn't understand. But I'll teach him a lesson about the heart of the cards.

[Cut to street]

Joey: Man, I hope he has some cool cards today.

Yuugi: Me too!

Téa: Yeah!

[Cut to Game Shop]

Joey: Okay Gramps, I'm back to get more cards. Hey, hey Gramps!

Yuugi: Grandpa, I'm home.

Téa: Maybe he... went out?

Joey: Maybe. But why would he leave the door unlocked?

[a phone rings]

Yuugi: [picks it up] Hello. Game Shop.

Seto: *Ahh, Yuugi. Perfect.*

Yuugi: Kaiba?!

Seto: Your grandfather's here visiting. But he's not feeling well. Why don't you come by my office and pick him up.

Yuugi: Kaiba! What've you done, Kaiba?!

[Cut to KaibaCorp building]

[Yuugi, Téa, Joey, and Tristan run into an elevator]

[Cut to upper floor of KaibaCorp, the elevator opens and Yuugi runs out]

Yuugi: Grandpa! Grandpa. A-are you okay?

Solomon: [props himself up on his elbows] Yuugi. I failed. I wanted to teach that boy Kaiba a lesson about the heart of the cards, but I lost. [groans]

Yuugi: Grandpa!

Seto: How's the old man feeling, hmmm?

Joey: Kaiba, you sleeze. What've you done to him?

Seto: We had a duel, that's all. With each of us putting up our most valuable card as the prize. But I guess playing against a champion like myself was just too much stimulation for the old fool.

Téa: [points at Seto] Kaiba, you should be ashamed of yourself.

Seto: It was fair. [holds up the BEWD] And look at the sweet prize I won. [begins tearing it up]

All: [gasp]

Yuugi: Grandpa's most treasured card!

Seto: Yes, the Blue-Eyes White Dragon is a rare and powerful card and this one will never be used against me. 

Solomon: Ahh, my Blue-Eyes White Dragon. My treasure. 

Yuugi: Grandpa! Hold on. [looks up at Seto] How could you do such a thing? 

Solomon: Yuugi, here. [holds up Duel Monsters deck] Take this. 

Yuugi: Huh? Grandpa. 

Solomon: I built this deck. I put my soul in these cards. And I taught you everything I know, Yuugi. Take them. Take my cards and teach him respect. Teach Kaiba respect for the heart of the cards, Yuugi.

Yuugi: But Grandpa, you need help. I've got to get you to a doctor. 

Seto: That sounds like an excuse. Your friends can care for your grandfather while you and I duel.... unless you're afraid? 

Joey: Take him Yuugi!

Yuugi: Huh? [turns back to friends]

Joey: We can take care of your grandpa while you take care of creepy Kaiba. Teach that rich, spoiled brat what a real duel's all about.

Téa: For your grandpa, Yuugi.

Yuugi: I don't know...

Joey: Trust me, you're like the best player I've ever seen, and you've got the Millennium Puzzle. You can do this Yuugi! I know you can!

Téa: We all do. 

Yuugi: [nods, reaches for the deck] Okay, Grandpa. I'll do it.

Solomon: I know you will, my boy. 

Téa: [whips out black marker] Everyone, put your hands together and I'll mark us with a special sign. [draws a smiley face on their combined hands]

Joey: What gives, Téa? 

Téa: It's a symbol of our friendship so when Yuugi's dueling, no matter how tough it gets, he'll know that he's not alone, we're all right there with him.

[Cut to exterior of KaibaCorp building, an ambulance pulls up and Tea, Joey, and Tristan rush Solomon out to it.

Téa: Joey, Tristan and I will take Yuugi's grandpa to the hospital. Why don't you get back in there and cheer Yuugi on? 

Joey: Okay, take good care of him, Téa.

[Cut to dueling arena]

Seto: I designed this virtual stadium myself. Impressive, hmmm? I think you'll agree, it adds a bit more life to the game. We each begin with two thousand life points, the first player to hit zero loses. Are you ready to play, runt?

Yuugi: Play-time is over, Kaiba. [close-up of the Millennium Puzzle, Yuugi transforms into Yami no Yuugi]

Seto: What the-?

Yami: Now, Kaiba, prepare yourself, because it's time to duel.

Seto: Virtual systems ready. So let's begin. I attack with the mighty Hitotsu Me Giant. Brace yourself, Yuugi. You've never dueled like this before.

[Hitotsu Me Giant appears on playing field]

Yami: [recoils] He's brought the monster on the card to life. 

Seto: It's my virtual simulator. It creates life-like holograms of every Duel Monster. 

Yami: So this is how you beat my grandfather. Well now it's my turn. I call on the winged dragon- Guardian of the Fortress.

[Guardian of the Fortress appears on playing field]

Joey: Whoa, monsters! Real monsters!

Yami: Fireball attack!

[Guardian of the Fortress blasts Hitotsu Me Giant with a fireball. Hitotsu Me Giant shatters] 

[enter Mokuba]

Mokuba: Big brother!

[Seto's life-points are reduced from 2,000 to 1,800]

Mokuba: Are you alright?

Joey: Alright! Go Yuugi!

Seto: Hah. Well played, Yuugi... for a beginner. But how will you deal with this?

[Saggi the Dark Clown appears on playing field]

Yami: Saggi the Dark Clown? But that card has hardly any attack strength. 

Seto: True, your winged dragon's attack is fourteen hundred, while my dark clown's is only six hundred, but if I combine it with this card...

Yami: Ahh, A magic card! 

Seto: Exactly. The Negative Energy Generator. It multiplies my monster's attack by three. Dark Clown, attack with Dark Light!

[Saggi attacks Guardian of the Fortress. Guardian of the Fortress dissolves. Yami's life-points go from 2,000 to 1,600]

Seto: As you can see, combining cards can be very effective. 

Yami: He's good. He knows every aspect of this game. But my grandpa put all of his gaming knowledge, his whole heart, into assembling this deck. I have to believe that it holds some secret strategy. [looks at card he's just drawn] Ah, this card is useless. I can't beat the Dark Clown with this. I'll have to use a different monster in defense mode. The monster will be sacrificed, but my overall life-points will be safe.

Seto: Dark Light Attack! 

[Yami's face-down card dissolves]

Joey: Hang in there, Yuugi!

Seto: You're not faring any better than the old man did, Yuugi. Your deck is just as weak and feeble as your grandfather. 

Yami: My grandpa is a great man, and a better duelist than you'll ever be. He entrusted me with his cards and I can feel his heart in this deck. I doubt you have that kind of faith in your cards, Kaiba.

Seto: Wha-?

Yami: [draws, smirks] And my faith rewards me with Gaia the Fierce Knight! With a destructive power of twenty three hundred.

Seto: Ahh.

[Gaia appears on playing field and attacks. Saggi dissolves. Kaiba's life-points are reduced from 1,800 to 1,300]

Joey: Way to go, Yuugi!

Yami: Alright, Kaiba, your move.

Seto: Hah. This'll be over sooner than you think. [draws] Hmm. I call on the Blue-Eyes White Dragon.

[BEWD appears on playing field]

Yami: No way.

Joey: Impossible! We all watched Kaiba tear that card in half.

Seto: Surprised? Did you think your grandfather was the only one to possess a Blue-Eyes White Dragon?

[BEWD attacks Gaia. Gaia dissolves.]

Yami: Argh.

[Yami's life-points are reduced from 1,600 to 900]

Seto: Your Fierce Knight is destroyed. Faith or no faith, you will fall before my superior monsters, Yuugi. Power is what this game is all about, you fool. Faith is for losers... like your pathetic grandfather. In your entire deck, there's not a single card that can stand up to a Blue-Eyes White Dragon. [holds up another BEWD] So what hope do you have against two? 

[Second BEWD appears on playing field]

Seto: Why don't you just admit defeat, Yuugi?

[Cut to interior of a hospital. Solomon has an oxygen mask and is being rushed down a hallway on a stretcher]

Solomon: Don't give up... Yuugi.

[Cut back to the dueling platform]

Yami: I won't give up. Grandpa's counting on me. [draws] Huh, a magic card. Swords of Revealing Light! It stops all monsters on the field for three turns.

[Glowing swords appear around the BEWDs]

Seto: How desperate. What possible good will a three turn delay do you?

Yami: He's right. What do I do? I can't figure out what to do with these cards. They're just a bunch of... pieces. How can I use them to battle an expert like Kaiba?

Solomon's voice: For someone claiming to have faith, you're giving up too easily, Yuugi.

[Solomon appears inside Yami's head]

Solomon: Listen, sometimes the cards are like a puzzle. You have to put all the different pieces in their proper place.

Yami: Ahh, like the Millennium Puzzle?

Solomon: Exactly. Each piece helps build a greater entity.

[Solomon disappears from inside Yami's head]

Yami: Grandpa!

Solomon's voice: Like the pieces of a puzzle, Yuugi. Remember...

Yami: Puzzle? When are the cards like a puzzle? Wait! Grandpa once said, "Duel monsters contains only one unstoppable monster- Exodia. But he can only be summoned by drawing all five special cards. A feat that, to this very day, no one has ever accomplished."

Seto: Quit your stalling, Yuugi. Or you will be forced to forfeit the match.

Yami: I never forfeit. [draws] Huh? Another piece of the puzzle.

Seto: Draw any card you like, it won't change a thing. My dragons may be frozen for another two turns, but my new monster is under no such spell. The Judge Man, with an attack power of twenty-two hundred.

[Judge Man appears on playing field and attacks Yami's monster, which dissolves]

Yami: [draws] I can attack with the Dark Magician. But he won't stand a chance once Kaiba's dragons are free of my spell.

[DM appears on playing field]

Yami: Dark Magician... attack! 

[DM attacks the Judge Man, Judge Man dissolves. Kaiba's life-points are reduced from 1,300 to 1,000]

Yami: Judge Man falls.

Seto: Ahh, a sacrifice that doesn't even phase me. And though neither dragon can move for one more turn, my next card is... the third Blue-Eyes White Dragon! 

Yami: Nngh!

[the third BEWD appears on the playing field]

Seto: Now my dragon, attack!

[the BEWD attacks DM. DM dissolves. Yami's life-points are reduced from 900 to 400]

Seto: So tell me, Yuugi, how's your faith now? On my next turn, all three Blue-Eyes White Dragons are free to attack. This game's over no matter what card you draw. You can't possibly stand against my three Blue-Eyes White Dragons. It's over, Yuugi. You were never a match for me.

Joey: Don't listen, Yuugi!

Yami: Kaiba had three Blue-Eyes all along. He only wanted my grandpa's card so it couldn't be used against him. My only chance now is to assemble all the pieces of Exodia. But the odds are against me. I don't think I can do this. Wha- [he reaches for the deck, it appears to move away from his hand] The deck! It senses my doubt! [Yami and Yuugi split for a moment] Don't lose focus, Yuugi. Don't lose faith. Concentrate! [they meld back together] Wha-? [looks down at his hand] Our friendship symbol! 

[Téa, Tristan and Joey appear next to the deck in Yuugi's mind] 

Téa: Yuugi, we're right here with you.

Tristan: Yuugi, you've got to believe in yourself.

Joey: You can do it. Just kick Kaiba's butt.

Yami: They're right. I've got to believe in the cards like my friends believe in me.

Seto: Draw your last pathetic card so I can end this, Yuugi.

Yami: My grandpa's deck has no pathetic cards, Kaiba. But it does contain... [holds up card] the unstoppable Exodia!

Seto: Ahh! [recoils] Impossible!

Yami: I've assembled all five special cards. All five pieces of the puzzle.

[a blue star appears on the playing field and Exodia's limbs appear inside it, one by one]

Seto: Exodia! Ahh, it's not possible! No one's ever been able to call him!

Yami: Exodia Obliterate!!

[Exodia Obliterates]

Seto: AHHHHHH!

[Seto's life-points are reduced from 1,000 to 0]

Joey: You did it! Yuugi, you won!

Mokuba: This can't be. My brother never loses.

Yami: You play only for power, Kaiba, and that is why you lost. But if you put your heart in the game, there is nothing you can't do.

Seto: But... but how? How could I have lost to him?

Yami: Kaiba, if you truly want to know... [cue glowing forehead-eye] ...open your mind!

Seto: [shatters, falls to knees]

Yami: There Kaiba, maybe now you will begin to see...

[Cut to interior of the hospital, Solomon opens his eyes]

Solomon: Huh?

Téa: Grandpa's awake!

Solomon: Yuugi won.

[cut to a dark room]

Lackey: Mr. Pegasus, sir. Seto Kaiba, our uncontested champion, he's... been defeated in a duel, sir, by someone named Yuugi.

Pegasus: Hmmm... [Millennium Eye flashes]

[Cue endtheme]
