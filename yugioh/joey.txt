 Ummm...  Hey Tristan, Yuugi here's teaching me how to play Duel Monsters.  Duel Monsters, you nimrod.  Okay Yuugi. It's time to duel. Pretty good move, huh Yuugi? What?! Thanks a lot. A card that powerful totally wipes me out. Your own game shop. What're we waiting for? Let's go! Pretty please? Awesome! Speaking of priceless, I'm ready to trade!  Huh? Nah, I didn't mean that card. I meant, show me some other cool cards to get me started. Kaiba?!  Hey, are you into Duel Monsters too? This is perfect. Maybe we could all duel together sometime.  What?  Ooh, I'm shaking. Maybe you'd like to settle this with fists instead of cards. But Yuugi, Kaiba's asking for it. Man, I hope he has some cool cards today. Okay Gramps, I'm back to get more cards. Hey, hey Gramps! Maybe. But why would he leave the door unlocked? Kaiba, you sleeze. What've you done to him? Take him Yuugi! We can take care of your grandpa while you take care of creepy Kaiba. Teach that rich, spoiled brat what a real duel's all about. Trust me, you're like the best player I've ever seen, and you've got the Millennium Puzzle. You can do this Yuugi! I know you can! What gives, Téa?  Okay, take good care of him, Téa. Whoa, monsters! Real monsters! Alright! Go Yuugi! Hang in there, Yuugi! Way to go, Yuugi! Impossible! We all watched Kaiba tear that card in half. Don't listen, Yuugi! You can do it. Just kick Kaiba's butt. You did it! Yuugi, you won! Okay, here you go, tough guy. My Rock Ogre's gonna rock your block off. Yeah, Téa. Like that wimpy card has a chance against my giant rock guy. Give it up! Huh? Can she do that? Ahh!  Tristan's right, Yuugi. I do stink. I can't win at Duel Monsters to save my life. What is it, Yuugi? Why can't I ever win? Teach me what I'm doing wrong. Huh? 'Kay...  Here you go. Powerhouse liner, don't you think? You got it, I packed it with every butt-kicking monster I could find. Huh?  Hah! See? That's the kind of stuff I need to know! Yuugi, you've gotta help me learn more! I was hoping, since you know more about Duel Monsters than anyone, maybe you'd teach me. Yeah. Tell me about it. Téa beat me three games in a row. Five? Aww man. Ahh. Piece of cake. Ahh!  Please, Yuugi. Help me convince him. I will work hard, I promise! Huh? You mean it, Gramps? I'll do anything, I promise. I promise! Uhhh... No? ...Noooo Kinda... Uhh, I have no idea. Bug Boy versus Dinosaur Man, what kind of match is that? That should've been me in there!  Sure, rub it in.   So tired. Must rest.  I must've been nuts to think I could ever learn this crazy game. Wha-? We're not done? Nnngh.    Industrial Illusions! That's the company that makes the Duel Monsters game. Why the heck would they be sending a package to you, Yuugi?  Just hearing Kaiba's name gives me a headache.  Yuugi, are these guys any good? Itsy-bitsy bugs against dueling dinosaurs? Raptor has got this one in the bag. He plays a wimpy bug against a giant dinosaur? The place'll be covered in bug guts. Man, King Rex squashed by an insect? And stars. Pop it in and check it out. Pegasus? Wha-? He can't seriously expect you to fight a duel against a video tape. And stars.  Serenity? Serenity, don't go! Waaaaaaait! Run out of time? It can't be. Huh? Serenity. So, that's where Pegasus is keeping your grandpa? Right. And without invitations, we can't even go there with you. I wish we could help you, pal. Three mill? Hey, gimme that.  Ahh. Three million. Three million. In cold cash. Hmm? Ah, nothing. I'm just thinking about a whole lot of stuff. Yuugi, you do know that I care about your gramps, right? I mean, he taught me about the heart of the cards. I mean it. One way or another, I'll help you beat Pegasus.  Remember the first time we met? Hah, you mean when we were playing keep away with the Millennium Puzzle? It was for you, man. We just wanted to toughen you up so you could stand up to the real bullies. We were only teasing you. He was a mean one alright. Shhh. Huh? You stood up for us, Yuugi. I'll never forget that. Because of you, we got that moron expelled. And Tristan and I learned what it was like to have a true friend. I want to apologize to you, Yuugi. I've been acting like a real jerk.  Guess I deserved that one. If you ask me, I think Tristan and I may've underestimated you. You know, Yuugi. You're a tougher kid than I ever gave you credit for. Maybe we should hang out more often. What do you say? The truth of the matter is, you're the best friend I've ever had. Don't worry. Some how, some way, I promise we'll do it together. You bet. We're a team, Yuugi. Hmmm.... How do you know I'm not official? No way. I came here to duel and I'm gonna duel. Hey, Yuugi. Hah. Did you really think I'd let you do this on your own? C'mon, help me out. I do? What's this? Yuugi. Only because you sacrificed one of your star chips for me. But if any of the other players find out we only have one star chip each, they could really try to take advantage of us. Kinda exciting, isn't it Yuugi?and Yuugi: Huh?  Wow. Whoa. Check it out. Hey miss, I'm a really good friend of Yuugi, the master duelist, in fact- Please, crush me. Hey, is this a joke or what? This is a luxery cruiser. I know you've got better rooms somewhere. Weevil. And Rex the dino duelist. Yeah? Well this time, Yuugi and I are going to take the tournament. Right Yuugi? Strength is good, but you also need to combine them with other types of cards. We'll see who stomps who when we get to the island. What d'ya mean? Oh! Strong cards! Hey, wanna trade? How about you? Anybody? Help me out here. Yuugi, I got some good card trading in. Alright. So now I'm ready to win every duel I play.  Thanks. I'll take it. I can't get over how you're always helping me out. Why you-! I'll get 'em!  I promise you, I'll get them, Yuugi! Don't worry, Yuugi. Look, there. I got one of them. No way. At least this time there's something I can do to help someone I care about.  Yuugi, just three more.  I'm sorry, Yuugi. I failed. I only found two of your cards. It's not okay. It's always this way with me. I'm never able to help anybody. Not even my own sister, Serenity. Our parents divorced years ago, when we were kids. She lives far away with my mother. My sister's had really bad eyes since she was born. Eventually she'll go blind. Thanks, Yug'. She sent me a message.  The doctors told her that the time has come. Soon her eyes will be impossible to repair, even with surgery. But there are specialists who could perform an operation now, before it's too late. They could save her eyesight. But... there's no way I can pay for the operation. I have to win. For her! Winning in the Duelist Kingdom, and getting the prize money, is the only way I can help Serenity!
